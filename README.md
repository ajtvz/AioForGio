AIO â€” Simple Website for My Mom, Gio.

This is an all-in-one, easy-to-use website I built for my mother, Gio. Sheâ€™s new to computers and finds navigating multiple websites a bit overwhelming.

To make things easier, Iâ€™ve gathered all the sites she uses into one simple homepage â€” clean, readable, and effortless to set up.
Plus, it includes a rotating gallery of family photos to bring a bit of comfort and joy while she browses.
