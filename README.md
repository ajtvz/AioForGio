AIO Simple website for my mother "Gio". She is very new to computers and has a hard time navigating anything.

So why not automate all the websites she needs to be on and put it all in one place, easy to read, easy to set up and with the addition of the family photos,
help mitigate stress by rotating a gallery of family photos of our family so she can explore and forget about the outside world for a bit.


Set up:
1. Clone git
2. Set the file location as the default homepage for any browser
3. Done, Enjoy
